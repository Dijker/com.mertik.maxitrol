### Homey app to control your fireplace from Homey with the Mertik Maxitrol protocol.

Use your remote to add a device to control your fireplace. The app support the Mertik Maxitrol protocol used on the 433 Mhz frequency. This is used by several brands like Bellfires, Dru etc. 

Setting it to full on or off should work without a problem, setting it to a certain percentage might be tricky.

Notes:

* This app is not supported.
* Signal reception/pattern recognition in Homey is flaky. Hence a lot of signal transmissions are not received by Homey.
* There is no plan to submit this app in the Athom App Store.
